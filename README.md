Hearthstone

# Presentation
The user(s) sees a Hearthstone board with 7 slots on each side for their monsters. The first player can see their cards in the bottom right, while the second player can see their cards on the top left. These cards are each player's current hands. During a player's turn, they can see their own current hand but not the opponent's. However, monsters that are placed are visible to both users.

# How the Project Works
During their turn, each player drags monsters onto their 7 slots on their side. The player can also attack the other side's monsters, but a monster can only attack once per turn. Once a player is finished attacking/placing cards, they press the "End Turn" button, which lets the other player go. The process repeats until one player has no HP left.
