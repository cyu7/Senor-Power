Which jobs are most crucial?
0. Learn to push (git commit -am "work" then git push)

1. Make a new player 2 named chris on the top of the board and give it the same functionality as nicolas, the player on the bottom of the board

2. Add decks (Shaman and Paladin)

3. Make monsters be able to attack

4. Learn enums

5. Playability

6. Making cards snap into place

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
Everything but 4 and 6 is essential. 4 is not essential because if we can't figure out how to make them work, then we can just use an int to track the type of card.
6 is not essential because right now the user has enough leniency in landing the center of the card into the box. 

Which components are prerequisites for others?
5 depends on 3 and 3 depends on 1. 2,4, and 6 can be done separately. 

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
2, 4 and 6 can all be delegated, while 1,3, and 5 should ideally be worked on in a group.

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
We hope to finish 1 by Saturday, which leaves 3 for Sunday and 5 for Sunday/Monday. 2 and 4 should be done by Saturday.
