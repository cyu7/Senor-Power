Which jobs are most crucial?
The next 4 things we plan to do are 
1. Having a space that can read cards placed on top of it and a button that runs the method on said card

2. Make a player Class that has HP (int), MP (int), max MP (int), currentHand (Card ArrayList), and monsters (Card[]) instance variables:
HP - health points of player, 30 at most
MP - mana points, can have at most (max MP), which changes based on # of turns played
max MP - maximum number of MP points, starts at 1 the first turn and increases by 1 after each turn
currentHand - current set of cards
monsters - array of monsters that are active on your side, 7 at most

3. Make a card class with instance variables cardType (enum), damage, health
cardType - three different card types (monster, weapon, spell), all with different effects (Possibly different instance variables)
damage- amount of damage a card does 
health- amount of health a card has

3. Getting cards to affect instance variables of the Player class

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
All four of these steps are essential

Which components are prerequisites for others?
1 must be done before 2 which must be done before 3 which must be done before 4

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
All of these tasks can be delegated, but it would be convenient to have one person do 1 and 4 while another person does 2 and 3

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
We hope to finish all 4 of these things by Thursday/Friday. If these steps need more time, then we can use the weekend as well
